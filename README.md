# OmniParser

**OmniParser** is a multimodal document understanding model developed by Microsoft. It combines icon detection and vision-language captioning to parse and extract structured information from visually-rich documents such as forms, tables, and charts. This repository contains code and instructions to set up and run OmniParser locally, including a Gradio-based user interface for demonstration.
